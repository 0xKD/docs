Docs on Docs

So, you want to write the docs for your project?

    What on earth do I write?

Well, you've come to the write place.

The goal here is to explain how to write docs, and what you should be doing. A lot of projects are different, and a lot are the same. We will be covering the tactics to write documentation for a few different topics. Choose your audience below and let us start talking to them.

Open Source Developers
----------------------

You have some awesome open source code. Too bad nobody is using it. The chance of someone discovering and using your awesome code goes up greatly with good documentation.

Start with the :doc:`basics`, and that should give you some food for thought to get started.


Developers at a company
-----------------------

You need help justifying writing documentation for your project. It seems the timelines you're given hardly has any time to write tests, and docs always get put off until the end. Well here are some ways that you can show value to your boss, and hopefully get the time to write the docs.

Get started with :doc:`mindshare`, which should give you a blueprint for how you can implement a documentation solution in your company.

Enterprise Users
----------------

You are a SAAS or Services company and you have developers as your target audience. If you don't have great documentation, your competitors will leave you in the dust. It will also jack up your support costs, because customers can't help themselves.
