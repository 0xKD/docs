Write the Docs Hike
====================

As you may or may not know, one of the organizers, Eric Holscher, is going to be hiking the `Pacific Crest Trail`_ this year. 
He knows a ton about hiking in the Portland area, and would love to show off some of the best parts in town.
In this spirit, we'll be having an official pre-conference hike!

We will be hiking in the amazing `Forest Park`_, the largest urban forested park in the country.
It is conveniently located in Northwest Portland, not far from the conference venue.
It's about a 35 minute walk, or you can `take transit`_ to make it a bit quicker.

What to bring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

April in Portland can be interesting. It will probably be in the 50s, with a chance of rain. So, please bring:

* Comfortable shoes, that you are comfortable getting a bit muddy.
* 1 Liter of water. There is water available halfway through the hike.
* A light rain jacket. It won't be cold, but it might drizzle on you.
* High spirits!


The hike
--------

The hike will be around 5 miles long, and have 1000 feet of elevation gain.
This classifies as a *moderate* hike.
We'll be going nice and slow so people can appreciate the views and forest.

Meander
~~~~~~~

It will follow Balch Creek up from the entrance of `Forest Park`_.

Climb
~~~~~

Then we will switchback through beautiful forest until we get to Pittock Mansion.
Pittock affords one of the best views of the city, and hopefully Mt. Hood & Mt. St. Helens if it's clear!

Admire
~~~~~~

After this we will descend into `Washington Park`_, and the beautiful `Hoyt Arboretum`_.
There are a number of paths through Hoyt, and we can play that by ear.
More than 5,800 specimens from around the world grow here, including more than 1,100 species, which are valuable in reforesting damaged habitats.

Finish
~~~~~~

On the other side of Hoyt is the `Oregon Zoo`_, where we can take the MAX back to downtown.
People who wish to stay around in the park or zoo are more than welcome.

After Party
-----------

We will be getting off the MAX near Bailey's Tap Room, which has 20 rotating
taps of the best beer in the Northwest. We will hang out here for a bit, and
then head over to the Write the Docs preregistration event to get everyone 
registered for the conference.
