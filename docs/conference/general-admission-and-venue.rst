Announcing Venue, General Ticket Sales, Additional Sponsors
===========================================================

Many new developments have occurred on the Write the Docs front lately.
Details have coalesced nicely for the conference, and we have some exciting announcements today.

Venue
-----

We searched far and wide to find a fitting venue for the inaugural Write the Docs. We are thrilled to hold the conference in the `Mission Theater`_ in Portland, Oregon. With roots as a Swedish Evangelical Mission and Longshoremanâ€™s Union, it is a wonderful building with a rich history.

Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, this building was dedicated by the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant Church of Portland on February 18, 1912. It has long been an important hub for communities, and we believe that it will be a fitting home for our new community of documentarians.

There is also a :doc:`venue page <venue>`, which has more photos and
information.

General Ticket Sales
--------------------

Tickets for the conference are `now available`_ for only **$75**. We're limiting conference tickets to a mere **200**, so be sure to buy yours right away. We were amazed at how quickly the early bird tickets sold out.

We want to keep the conference at a reasonable number of people, to help foster communication and craft a more intimate experience. The venue is the perfect size for the event, and we think it will work perfectly. 

Additional Sponsors
-------------------

We are proud to announce three additional sponsors for the conference. `Mozilla`_,
`Heroku`_, and `ESRI`_. Thanks to these awesome companies for helping make
Write the Docs possible!

Call for Proposals has ended
----------------------------

Last Monday the CFP for talks ended. We are overjoyed with the number and
quality of the talks submitted! The selection process is now over, and we will
be sending out emails to everyone who submitted a talk this week.

We should be able to announce the final schedule next week once we have
confirmed all of the speakers.
