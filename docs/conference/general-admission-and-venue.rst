Announcing the conference venue, general admission sales, and end of CFP
========================================================================

Lots of things have been happening on the Write the Docs front lately. Things
have been coming together nicely for the conference, and we have some exciting
announcements today. 

Venue
-----

We looked long and hard to find a fitting venue for the inaugural Write the Docs conference. So, we are very excited to be holding it in the `Mission Theater`_ in Portland, Oregon. With roots as a Swedish Evangelical Mission and Longshoreman's Union, it is a wonderful building with a lot of history.

The building, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, was dedicated by the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant Church of Portland on February 18, 1912. It has long been a cornerstone of many communities, and has served them well. We think that it will be a fitting home for our community of documentarians, though only for a few days.

If you are curious about the full history of the venue, there is a `historical brochure`_.

There is also a :doc:`venue page <venue>`, which we will be
updating as the conference nears. 

General Ticket Sales
--------------------

We are now selling tickets for the conference at the normal price of **$75**.
We are happy that the early bird tickets sold out as well. The total number of
tickets for the confernece is only **200**, so make sure to buy yours today.

We are happy to keep the conference at such a reasonable number of people,
because we think it will be a very intimate experience. The venue is the
perfect size for the event, and we're really excited!

Call for Proposals has ended
----------------------------

Last monday the CFP for talks ended. We are overjoyed with the number and
quality of the talks submitted! The selection process is now over, and we will
be sending out emails to everyone who submitted a talk this week.

We should be able to announce the final schedule next week once we have
confirmed all of the speakers.
