Welcome to Write the Docs!
==========================

Greetings Fellow Documentarians!

Write the Docs conference is upon us, and we wanted to give you some details about the event, venue, registration, evening events, and a bit about the surrounding area. Some of these details can be found on the `website`_, but please, read through this email...

Come by, pick up your badge, your swag, and have a free beer. We cannot recommend this enough!
