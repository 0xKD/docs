Announcing Conference Presentations, Pre Registration, and a Hike.
======================================================================

Things are coming along nicely here at Write the Docs. The conference is a little over a month away! With that in mind, we now have a full list of the talks, and a couple of fun tidbits before the conference as well.

Presentations
-------------

Presentations are the main event of the conference. We are really excited about the quality and scope of the presentations. We think there will be a little bit for everyone, and hopefully it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

The `full list of talks`_ is available. If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Pre Registration
----------------

Sunday evening everyone should be in town before the conference. We'll be having a small event to handle pre-registering people, so you can grab a bit more sleep in the morning. Have a couple drinks and get to know other folks who are in town for the conference, in a relaxed setting. We'll have more details about time and location as the conference gets closer.

Hike
----

Write the Docs is in Portland, and we love to show off our city. In that spirit, we'll be having a `Write the Docs Hike`_ on Sunday at 1pm, the day before the conference. The beginning and the end of the hike are located nearby the conference venue, to make it easily accessible to everyone. We will be hoping for good weather, but bring some light rain gear just in case :)

That's all for this announcement, but we have a couple more fun things planned for the conference. We are counting down the days, and look forward to seeing everyone in Portland.
