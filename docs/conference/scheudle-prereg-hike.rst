Announcing Schedule, Preregistration location, Hike registration and More
=========================================================================

Write the Docs is only a week and a half away. I hope you all already have your tickets. They are almost all sold out, so if you haven't gotten yours yet, make sure to `do it soon`_.

Schedule is now live
--------------------

We have released the `final schedule`_ for the conference. We tried to group the talks into themes in between each break, and think it should flow nicely together. 

Preregistration location
------------------------

`Urban Airship`_ will be graciously hosting our preregistration event. They are located about 6 blocks from the venue, so it should be an easy place to get to. The event will last from 6-8ish, and that means you can get another hour of sleep in the morning.

The address is 334 NW 11th St, Portland, Or.

Hike Registration
-----------------

We have added a registration to the Hike, so that we have a head count for the event. We are capping the hike at 20 people, because more than that in the woods is a bit ridiculous. `Register now`_ for the hike, if you want to come explore the Portland woods with us.
