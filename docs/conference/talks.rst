Ana Nelson -Integrating Development, Documentation and Reporting    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Let's explore the amazing things that happen when you combine reporting with documentation. We'll start with a retro-chic command-line task management tool named 'ado', and create a beautifully modern D3-based interactive task explorer (no server necessary). Learn how powerful documentation-driven development can be, and the benefits of freeing documentation and reporting from their usual separate silos. 

    In this talk we will simultaneously document Bash, Python, SQL, CSS, HTML and JavaScript using HTML, PDF, epub, Excel and .docx formats (with just a single command!). You'll learn about Dexy, the document and data automation tool that makes this possible by working alongside the documentation tools you already know and love.

Andrew Kuchling - Why Projects Should Have "What's New" Documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    Describes the speaker’s experience writing What’s New documents
    covering the new features in each Python 2.x release. The editorial
    policies will be summarized, and the speaker argues that large
    projects should include a “What’s New” as part of their standard
    documentation set.


Ann Goliak - Helping the help pages 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

Ashleigh Rentz - The technical challenges of serving docs at Google’s scale 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Google Code launched in 2005, hosting documentation for Google’s public APIs and Open Source software. Five years later, massive growth in the company’s developer offerings had pushed the site’s infrastructure to the max. What sorts of problems can sneak up when you go from 11 APIs to over a hundred? Or when many of those docs rapidly expand from hundreds to thousands of pages? And how can you build a serving infrastructure that won’t leave a room of execs holding their collective breath when new products launch at your annual showpiece conference?  

    Join Google Developer Programs’ Ashleigh Rentz for a behind-the-scenes retrospective: learn what it took to migrate a massive documentation library to a new home at Google Developers (developers.google.com) without freezing the existing site and how the new backend leverages both Open Source and Google technology to provide a CMS that truly scales.

Brandon Philips - Single Page Docs: Stop the Click Insanity
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    Multi-page docs are the norm in most documentation framework. However, they aren't the best tool for the job of creating usable docs.

    Take for example the docs found on readthedocs.org for `Django Fluent Contents`_. This is a very normal looking sphinx project. Now lets try to find example code for the `announcementblock` plugin:

    - Ctrl+F "announcementblock". Darn, ok, no results.
    - Ctrl+F "plugins", Nope, Enter, Nope, Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter
    - Click on the link for example code, there it is! Woo!

    This style of code docs forces users to guess, click around, or simply leave your docs and use a Google `site:` search.

    A better alternative is single page docs like those for `Express JS`_. In this talk I will explore the best patterns and tools for single page documentation. And also explore the features and niceties that take single page docs from good to great.

Daniel Lindsley - The Unenviable Tutorial 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    It's the first thing every new user looks for, the raison d'être of every project, almost always will completely divide the people evaluating your software & is the leading cause of liver cancer in the American pub... wait, no. Forget that last part. What I'm talking about is the Tutorial.

    Frequently the first bit of documentation written, the first one to fall hopelessly out of date & the one *everyone* sees, the Tutorial bears the brunt of getting people started. Its job is to pull people in. It teaches them not only what the software is about, but *how* it should be used. It sets the stage, the standard & the lowest bar of entry. It's unenviable because it must do so many things & do them well to be a success.

Daniya Kamran - Translating Science into Poetry 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Whether you're writing a grant, putting together a speech, giving a lecture, or conducting any sort of expression through a document, you're asking the reader to respond to a narrative. Especially when you're dealing with subjects like science, technology, education, or business, developing a compelling narrative can be increasingly difficult. Technical writers deviate from risky narratives because too much of their readership is focused on professionalism. What is unnecessary? What is "flowery"? What makes you comes across as less of a scientist? This talk demonstrates how to extract narratives from technical documents by utilizing lessons learned from poetry, and especially focus on using these narratives to create compelling supplementary documents from scientific data, such as infographics, talks, or impact assessments

James Socol - UX and IA at Mozilla Support, and Helping 7.2 Million More People   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    `Mozilla Support`_ has gone through a number of usability and information architecture evaluations over the past year and a half, the biggest of which helps us help 7.2 million additional people every year find the answers they need.

    I'll talk about some of the techniques and tools we've used (like heuristic evaluation, card sorts, treejack) and how to play along at home and apply these techniques to your own docs.

Jennifer Hartnett-Henderson - Dual Coding with Sketchnotes and Hand Lettering
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    Dual coding theory says that if pick any 2 of Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic or Reading/Writing you can learn more and teach more. In this short form talk, I'll show how sketchnotes and hand lettering can both spice up your documents and increase retention. 

    1. What are sketchnotes?  How are they different from art? From drawing? Challenge: draw one sketchnote during this talk.
    2. What is hand lettering? How is it different from Typography?
    3. What are examples in documentation where these techniques have been used
    4. Why bother? Dual coding theory, brain research
    5. What's in it for me? 
    6. Simple ways to get started (basic tools, easily available resources including books, flickr groups, websites)
    7. If you don't want to do it yourself where can you find resources
    8. Share your sketchnote from this talk: Twitter, Flickr



Jim R. Wilson - Describe, Defend, Differentiate and Deliver 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Many of us work for companies that fancy themselves software companies.
    Nominally though, what we produce is functionality, not software.
    And functionality is only worth while if people can use it.

    In this talk, I'll advocate for a wholistic approach to software development which incorporates documentation thinking at many levels.
    Documentation in its many forms can achieve diverse and sometimes accidental goals.
    With battle scars from real situations, I'll show how you can use documentation not only to describe, but to defend, differentiate and deliver.


Kenneth Reitz - Documentation is King
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Documentation leads to better code.

    Every design decision should be documented. Imagine not having to have tap your coworkers on the shoulder when you're working on an unfamiliar part of the codebase, or on-boarding a new employee. Imagine being able to make the change, run the tests, and push to production without questioning yourself, because the process was documented — or better yet, automated.

Kevin Hale - Getting Developers and Engineers to Write the Docs  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    At Wufoo, everyone has to wear multiple hats in our company and that includes manning the inbox and doing customer support every single week. One of the interesting side effects of having a company where designers, developers and even the accountant writing documentation and  answering support emails, is that everyone has a stake in making sure the application is as easy to use as possible.  

    We've called this approach to creating software Support Driven Development and in this talk Kevin Hale, one of the founders of Wufoo, will share how this model transformed every member of their company to be dedicated to the principles of clarity and simplicity.

Leah Cutter - Generating a Culture of Doc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    How do you encourage engineers to do the write thing?  (Not a typo.) 

    At Salesforce.com, we now have a team called, "Core Documentation." We are primarily focused on documenting our internal systems and architecture. Many of us on the team don't create content: We generate framework, best practices, and training for engineer-created content. (Content can include and is not limited to: code comments, run lists, specs, team web pages, wikis, white papers, architectural diagrams, presentations, etc.) 

    But that goes back to the first question--how do you get someone to write, when the word "writer" isn't part of their title? 

    We've been successful using several different venues:
    - Documentation "hack" day -- where engineers spend a day improving their internal doc
    - Events where posters of different aspects of the architecture are displayed (think art walk, only for engineers)
    - VERY easy to use templates for readme files, etc.
    - Lunch meetings/presentations/training/networking 
    - Flattery, appeals to logic (bus factor) and bribes

    Plus I would also present some of the things that haven't worked.




Matthew Butterick - Typography for Docs 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Should writers of documentation care about typography? As someone who reads a lot of documentation, I can see that many don't. But good typography can reinforce your meaning, conserve reader attention, and make your docs more inviting and useful. And it's easier than you might think. In this session I'll explain the four rules of typography that every writer of docs needs to know. I'll also cover some typographic issues specific to web-based docs, and critique a few real-world examples. 

Marcia Riefer Johnston - Write Tight(er) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    This presentation helps technical writers transform text into specimens of conciseness. With small screens squeezing the "page"—and with translations costing around $0.25 per word per language—this timeless skill gets more and more timely. Attendees will learn: 

    - How flabby writing hurts business. 
    - Why "concise" does not equal "short."
    - Why they don't need a double-standard to write for small screens. 
    - How to tighten and energize their writing.

Michael Verdi - How Mozilla supports users all over the world
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    The Mozilla support platform is built around a fully localizable wiki and an awesome community of volunteers. Together we're able to support nearly half a billion users in dozens of languages. This talk will focus on how we support the 50% of Firefox users who use it a language other than English.

Noirin Plunkett - Text Lacks Empathy
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

Nisha George & Elaine Tsai - Translating Customer Interactions to Documentation  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    If customers have problems they can’t find answers to or need to report an issue then they contact your Customer Support team. Support is first line of defense to keeping your customers happy. But, customers are happiest when they can find answers on their own without having to wait for a response from Support. When Support owns a portion of the docs: customers are empowered to find solutions on their own, the incoming volume of tickets reduces and companies can better scale their internal teams in relation to their growing customer base.  

    This presentation will cover the types of documentation that your company’s Support team should own along side the documentation maintained by Engineering. We will give examples of how your Support team can:

    - Turn incoming tickets into FAQs to prevent future tickets
    - Provide answers for all types of customers, from beginners to experts
    - Create positive experiences for customers and internal teams

Sarah Grant - Evolution of the English Language from Text to Texting  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **20 minutes**

    Or, Why the Oxford English Dictionary is My Favorite Book, and Why I Love the Chicago Manual of Style

    The Oxford English Dictionary holds the key to every word in the English language, starting with the language from which it was borrowed/stolen, following its history to current times, and giving examples of usage from the beginning. New words are introduced into common usage every year, and some make it into an official dictionary. Some words are practical (i.e., Internet), while others are superfluous (i.e., ironical) and many are just plain wrong {i.e., orientated). 

    The "correct" use of words and language seems to be more and more fluid these days. Will commonly used acronyms, seen mainly in texting and instant messaging, become part of the standard usage? How fluid SHOULD the English language be? What types of grammatical and punctuation changes are acceptable, and what types  are not? Where do we draw the line?

    This talk will present these questions and others, and begin to formulate possible answers to benefit the potential audience of writers.



Teresa Talbot - Technically Communicating Internationally   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Ever dreamed of working abroad? Often overlooked as an international career, technical documentation has taken me to nine countries and allowed me to work with many of the world's cultures. Truth is, if you're translating it's best to start with English. More people speak English as a second language than any other and, as you want translators to translate into their first language, it's easier and cheaper to translate from English. Come hear and share international experiences. Learn why and how I managed it legally. Gain tips and tricks for getting what you need from subject matter experts in a foreign (to you) culture and writing with translation in mind. Cultural shocks and embarrassing moments? I've got them and can help you avoid them.

    Countries where I've lived and worked:

    * USA
    * United Kingdom
    * New Zealand
    * Netherlands
    * Japan
    * Bulgaria
    * Spain
    * Switzerland
    * France

Tim Daly  - Literate Programming in the Large   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    **40 minutes**

    Axiom is an open source computer algebra system written mostly in Common Lisp. As one of the original authors at IBM Research I wrote a fair amount of code. Later Axiom was sold commercially as a competitor to Mathematica and Maple. When it was later withdrawn from the market I was given the code. It was soon apparent that, while what the code did was clear, why it did what it did was not. Being unable to understand my own code was a shock. Eventually I decided to reshape the code base using Knuth's Literate Programming technology. The idea is that one should be able to read Axiom like a book directed at human understanding, a book which incidently contains the actual source code of the system. This talk is a description of the first 10 years of that effort with insights into the challenges of writing a million-line literate program.
