Announcing Conference Videos, a New User Group, and a Mailing List
==================================================================

It's been a few months since the conference, and we hope everyone is enjoying their summer.
We hope that you've managed to keep some of the connections alive that you made at Write the Docs.
In that spirit, we have a couple of announcements today that might help you connect more.

Talk Videos are Posted
----------------------

The `talk videos`_ have been live for a few weeks, but we thought we should email you as well. 
We hope that you share them with friends and collegues that couldn't make the conference. 

A Bay Area User Group
---------------------

We have our first user group setting up! `Ruth Buchanan`_ has organized a great first meeting, and we hope that anyone in the area will come out and join. They are looking for speakers for the first and following meetups, so check it out.

A `mailing list`_
-------------------

Write the Docs is a larger idea than the conference. A big part of that is having a community around documentation. We have launched a `mailing list`_ that will allow people to chat about documentation related things from across the globe. If you are interested in chatting about docs or have questions you want to be answered, go ahead and sign up.

Cheers,
Write the Docs Team
