Announcing Conference Videos, a Meetup Group, and a Mailing List
==================================================================

It's been a few months since the conference, 
and we hope everyone is enjoying their summer.
We hope that you've kept some of the connections alive that you made at Write the Docs.
In that spirit, 
we have a couple of announcements today that will help you stay connected.

Talk videos are posted
----------------------

The `talk videos`_ are now live.
We hope that you share them with friends and collegues that couldn't make the conference. 

A Bay Area Meetup Group
-----------------------

We have our first `meetup group`_ setting up! `Ruth Buchanan`_ has organized a great first meeting, 
and we hope that anyone in the area will come out and join. 
They are looking for speakers for the first and following meetups, 
so `check it out`_.

Details:

* Topic - Teaching & Learning: Framing Documentation as a Teaching Tool
* Date - Thursday, September 12th from 6-8 PM
* Venue - Hosted and Sponsored by `Atlassian`_
* Awesome - Free beer, wine, and pizza

If you are interested in setting up a meetup group in your own area,
please `email us`_ if we can help at all.

A mailing list
--------------

Write the Docs is a larger idea than the conference. 
A big part of that is having a community around documentation. 
We have launched a `mailing list`_ that will allow people to chat about documentation related things from across the globe.
If you are interested in chatting about docs or have questions you want to be answered, 
go ahead and `sign up`_.

2014 Details
-------------

We are excited about having the conference again next year.
We will be announcing the dates of the conference,
and putting up a website in the next couple months. 

| Cheers,
| Write the Docs Team
