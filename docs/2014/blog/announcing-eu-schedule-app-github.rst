Write the Docs is right around the corner! We’re delighted to hold our first EU Write the Docs in Budapest, and we have some developments to share with you as the dates draw nearer. We’re announcing the schedule, a mobile app so you can easily check the schedule, and a Github-hosted evening event where you can get to know your fellow documentarians. 

Conference Schedule
-------------------

We’ve packed the agenda with all kinds of compelling talks. We have speakers discussing tone, typography, research, READMEs, and many other topics over the two day-conference. You can check out the `schedule`_.

We’ve also set aside time for lightning talks. We encourage you to bring ideas for short talks talks or discussions, and introduce yourself to the documentarian community. 

Mobile app
----------

We have a mobile app so you can check the schedule out on your phone. We hope you attend all the talks, and use this to get excited about the schedule on your way into the conference! 

You can access the `web version`_, or `download it`_.

GitHub Drinkup
--------------

Community is a huge part of Write the Docs. We want to create a culture where we can share best practices and drinks.  We’ve intentionally chosen a smaller venue for the conference - we want it to be conducive to getting to know the smart people around you. With the same purpose in mind, we invite you to the drinkup on Tuesday, April 1, hosted by our friends at GitHub.

The event will be free and open to the public. So it will be a great way to meet other local tech folk, and have a good time on GitHub.

With the conference party on Monday, that means there are evening events on both Monday and Tuesday. We hope that gives you plenty of oppertunity to meet other documentatarians.

That’s all for now! Cheers,
The Write the Docs Team
