Announcing EU Venue & Early Bird Tickets
========================================

We're excited to share the latest developments on Write the Docs EU.
We will be hosting the conference at the fantastic headquarters of `Prezi`_.
They have been kind enough to let us use their event space for our inaugural EU event.

Along with that,
we are announcing ticket prices,
and the availability of Early Bird tickets.

Venue: Prezi's House of Ideas
-----------------------------

Prezi's aptly named Budapest headquarters, 
the `House of Ideas <http://retaildesignblog.net/2013/05/13/prezi-office-by-minusplus-budapest-hungary/>`_,
serves as our 2014 venue. 
The House of Ideas boasts unique architecture, 
modern design, 
and a devoted space for conferences. 
Prezi's home gives us a fitting environment to come together and talk about making documentation great.

Early Bird Ticket Sales

We try hard to keep the conference affordable,
so that everyone in the documentation world can afford to come.
With that, we are really proud to announce that tickets this year will be **£55**.

We are also releasing a small number of Early Bird tickets for only **£39**.
There are only a limited number of Early Bird tickets,
so if you are already planning to come,
