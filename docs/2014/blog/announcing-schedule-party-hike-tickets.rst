Announcing the Schedule, Party, and Hike Tickets
================================================

The conference is almost here! We're looking forward to seeing everyone
in just a couple of weeks. Here's a few announcements as you prepare for
Write the Docs.

Check out the schedule
----------------------

We have an amazing lineup this year. We intentionally curated a diverse
array of documentation topics, so you can hear talks ranging
from tone to documenting cryptography libraries.

Check out the schedule here:

Party at Ground Kontrol
-----------------------

Join us at Ground Kontrol Monday night for classic arcade games and
drinks. Bring your badge, grab a refreshment, and challenge someone to a
`4-player Pac Man`_ match.

`Ground Kontrol`_ is located at 511 NW Couch St. We'll be there from
7:00-9:00 PM Monday night.

If Tekken or Frogger isn't your thing, we're announcing another venue option soon.

Get your hike ticket
--------------------

Join us for a hike through the Portland hills on Sunday afternoon. We go
slow so you can take in the views of Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens.

We can't bring the whole conference onto a single trail,
so there are a *limited number* of hike tickets.
`Get a ticket`_ for the hike if you'd like to come.

We leave at 1:00 PM from the Macleay Park entrance. `Check out route
details, tips, and photos here`_.

Get excited
-----------

We're looking forward to seeing everyone in a couple weeks. These conferences
are about more than sharing best practices for doc: they're about
creating living, breathing communities. Expect to meet great people and
learn interesting things.

| See you soon!
