Announcing Conference Talks and Party for Write the Docs EU
===========================================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `EU conference`_.
The conference is 45 days away,
and we are putting together the final touches.

Today we are proud to announce the talks and party for Write the Docs EU.

Talks
-----

Presentations are the main event of the conference. We are really excited about the quality and scope of the presentations. We think there will be a little bit for everyone, and hopefully it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

The `full list of talks`_ is available.
If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Party
-----

We will be having a party on Monday night at the conference.
This will give you an opportunity to get to know your fellow attendees a bit better,
and talk about the things we learned that day.

The party venue will be near the conference venue,
so you will be on your own for dinner,
but have an event to attend that evening.

Buy Tickets Now
---------------

We only have a limited number of tickets for the event.
If you are considering coming,
you should `buy your tickets`_ now.

There are only a few early bird tickets left,
so get them while you can.
