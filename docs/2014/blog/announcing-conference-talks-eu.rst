Announcing Conference Talks and Party for Write the Docs EU
===========================================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `EU conference`_.
The conference is 45 days away,
and we are putting together the final touches.

Today we are proud to announce the talks and party for Write the Docs EU.

Talks
-----

Presentations are the main event of the conference. We are really excited about the quality and scope of the presentations. We think there will be a little bit for everyone, and hopefully it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

The `full list of talks`_ is available.
If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Party
-----

We will be having a party on Monday night at the conference.
This will give you an opportunity to get to know your fellow attendees a bit better,
and talk about the things we learned that day.

The party venue is near the conference venue,
so you can head over after dinner on Monday night.

Announcing Student and Corporate tickets
----------------------------------------

We price the conference really inexpensively so that we make sure everyone is able to come.
This year we are adding a bit more flexibility to the pricing.
We know students have very little money,
so we are offering even cheaper tickets to them.

To cover the cost of the student tickets,
we are asking companies that are buying tickets for their employees to pay a little more.
This is *optional*,
but if your company is buying your ticket,
please consider paying a bit more to help us provide cheaper tickets to students.
