Announcing Portland Venue and Ticket Sales
==========================================

We are really excited for our `Portland conference`_ this year.
It was a huge success last year,
and based on that success we are going to have more tickets so more folks can come.

Those who came last year noticed we packed the Mission Theater,
so we had to search for a new venue this year.
Luckily Portland has lots of soulful venues,
and we settled on another one with a similarly great vibe.

The Crystal Ballroom
---------------------

This year's Portland conference will be held at the `Crystal Ballroom`_.
It is a beautiful concert venue located in the `middle of downtown`_ Portland.
We believe it will provide a great home for Write the Docs this year,
with room to grow in the future.

We listened to people's feedback last year,
and one of the biggest issues was the lack of a "Hallway Track".
To help solve that problem,
we also have booked `Lola's Room`_,
which is a separate space in the same building.
Lola's Room will be available for use by attendees throughout the conference.
The building also has a couple of other areas where you can have a conversation with someone new and interesting you just met.

Tickets are on sale
-------------------

Tickets for the conference are on sale!
We are keeping the same ticket prices as last year,
with a couple additions.
Early Bird are still **$55**, but limited.
General Admission are still **$75**.
We have added a Student ticket option,
so students can buy a ticket for **$50**.
To help cover the costs of doing this,
we are asking companies who are buying their employees tickets to pay a bit more.
Corporate tickets are **$100**.

Go ahead and `get your tickets now`_.

When you book your travel,
we recommend coming to Portland for the weekend before.
It's a great town,
and we will have optional events on Sunday afternoon.
You should also make sure you stay until the end on Tuesday,
which will be around 6pm.

Call for Proposals ends this weekend
-------------------------------------

If you are interested in speaking this year,
time is running out.
The Call for Proposals ends on **March 1st**,
which is this weekend.
If you have something to share with the community,
`submit a talk now`_.

Sponsorships are also still available for both conferences.
If your company would like to support the conference,
please email us at writethedocs@gmail.com for more info.

Budapest Conference Schedule
----------------------------

Don't forget that we are also running our first `European conference`_ this year in Budapest.
There is now an `official schedule`_ online.
If you know folks in Europe that might be interested,
please pass along the conference to them.
Tickets are `still available`_.

Conclusion
----------

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in Portland this spring.
There are a few more exciting things in the works,
so stay tuned for more announcements in the next few weeks.

As always,
`let us know`_ if you have any questions or concerns.
