Announcing Portland Venue, Ticket Sales, Initial Sponsors.
==========================================================

We are really excited for our Portland conference this year.
It was a huge success last year,
and based on that success we are going to have more tickets so more folks can come.

Those who came last year noticed we packed the Mission Theater,
so we had to search for a new venue this year.
Luckily Portland has lots of soulful venues,
and we settled on another one with a similarly great vibe.

The Crystal Ballroom
---------------------

This year's Portland conference will be held at the `Crystal Ballroom`_.
It is a beautiful concert venue located in the middle of downtown Portland.
We believe it will provide a great home for Write the Docs this year,
with room to grow in the future.

We listened to people's feedback last year,
and one of the biggest issues was the lack of a "Hallway Track".
To help solve that problem,
we also have booked `Lola's Room`_,
which will be open during the entire conference for different uses.
The venue also has a couple other areas where you can have a conversation with someone new and interesting you just met.

Tickets are on sale
-------------------

Tickets for the conference are on sale!
We are keeping the same ticket prices as last year,
with a couple additions.
Early Bird are still **$55**.
General Admission are still **$75**.
We have added a Student ticket option,
so students can always buy a ticket for **$50**.
To help cover the costs of doing this,
we are asking companies who are buying their employee's tickets to pay a bit more.
Corporate tickets are **$100**.

Go ahead and `get your tickets now`_.

Call for Proposals ends this weekend
-------------------------------------

If you are interested in speaking this year,
time is running out.
The Call for Proposals ends on **March 1st**,
which is this weekend.
If you have something to share with the community,

Initial Sponsors
----------------

We couldn't keep ticket prices this low and provide the experience that we do without our sponsors.
We are really grateful that they support us in this endeavor.
Thanks to our initial sponsors:

|Rackspace|_
|Mozilla|_


Sponsorship is still available,
you can email writethedocs@gmail.com for more information.

Budapest Conference Schedule
----------------------------

We have the `official schedule`_ for our EU conference in Budapest.
If you know folks in Europe that might be interested,
please pass along the conference to them.
Tickets are limited,
but `still available`_

Conclusion
----------

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in Portland this Spring.
There are a few more exciting things in the works,
so stay turned for more announcements in the next few weeks.

As always,
`let us know`_ if you have any questions or concerns.
