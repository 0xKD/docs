Announcing First Conference Talks for NA
========================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `NA conference`_.
The conference is 45 days away,
and we are putting together the final touches.

Today we are proud to announce the first set talks for Write the Docs NA.

Talks
-----

Talks are the main event of the conference. 
We are really excited about the quality and scope of the talks this year. 
There will be a little bit for everyone, 
and we believe it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

The `first talks`_ is available.
If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Portland Weekend
----------------

We love Portland and we hope that you will come into town for the weekend before the conference.
There will be a few events on Sunday before the conference,
so we highly recommend flying in either early Sunday or Saturday.

Last year we had a `hike`_ and a `pre-registration event`_.
This year will be something similar,
so don't miss out :)

That's all for this announcement, but we have a couple more fun things in the works for the conference. We are counting down the days, and look forward to seeing everyone in Portland!
