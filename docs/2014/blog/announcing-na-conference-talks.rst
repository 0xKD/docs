Announcing First Conference Talks and Events for North America
==============================================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `upcoming conference`_ in Portland, Oregon. 
It’s only 40 days away, and we’re putting together the final touches.
 
We’re excited to announce the first set of speakers and a few events before the conference where you can get to know your fellow documentarians.

Talks

The quality and diversity of speaker submissions this year is impressive. 
It’s made selecting talks difficult,

* Matthew Lyon - Minimum Viable Documentation
* Amelia Abreu - Data, Documentation, & Memory
* Susan Salurito - From Docs to Engineering and Back Again

* Kenneth Reitz - Documentation at Scale
* Mo Nishiyama - Did It In Minutes: The Art of Documenting Meeting Notes
* Nina Vyedin - Hacking the English Language
* Siobhan McKeown - Writing for Your Other Half
