Announcing First Conference Talks and Events for North America
==============================================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `NA conference`_.
The event is 40 days away,
and we are putting together the final touches.

Today we are proud to announce the first set talks,
and a few fun events before the conference.

Talks
-----

Talks are the main event of the conference. 
We are really excited about the quality and scope of the talks this year. 
There will be a little bit for everyone, 
and we believe it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

We are proud to announce the following talks:

* Marko Gargenta - TechDocs at Twitter: Creating the culture of documentation
* Matthew Lyon - Minimum Viable Documentation
* Amelia Abreu - Data, Documentation, & Memory
* Susan Salurito - From Docs to Engineering and Back Again
* Geoffrey Grosenbach - Graphical Explanations
* Alex Gaynor - Documenting Domain Specific Knowledge
* Kenneth Reitz - Documentation at Scale
* Mo Nishiyama - Did It In Minutes: The Art of Documenting Meeting Notes
* Nina Vyedin - Hacking the English Language
* Siobhan McKeown - Writing for your other half
* R. N. Homer Christensen - Flow: A Permaculture Approach to Documentation Projects

The `full abstracts`_ are also available.
If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Hike
----

We will be having a hike on Sunday before the conference.
Portland is one of the most beautiful cities in the USA,
and has wilderness inside city limits.
Come see what beauty hides in the hills behind town.

The hike will leave at 1pm.
More information can be found on the :doc:`Hike page </2014/na/hike>`.

Check out pictures from last years `hike`_ to see what it will be like.

Pre-Registration
----------------

Urban Airship will be kindly hosting the pre-registration event this year.
Get your badges early,
and get to know some other attendees before the conference starts.

Urban airship is located at *1417 NW Everett St*.
The event will run from **5pm to 8pm**,
allowing you time to find folks to grab dinner with.

Conclusion
----------

We will have more announcements about the conference over the next couple weeks.
The full list of talks and a party will be confirmed,
so look forward to that soon!

Don't forget to `buy a ticket`_ soon,
as we expect the event will sell out.
