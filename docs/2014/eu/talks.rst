Włodzimierz Gajda - How to write a technical book?
--------------------------------------------------

Writing interesting and informative books on technical topics requires a mixture of diverse abilities including technical expertise on a specific subject and communication skills.

One of the methods to verify the quality of writings that you plan to publish as your next book is to use them in real life scenario. That's just the way I use to write and publish my books. I begin with a small tutorial. Next, I use the tutorial for teching purposes. After this I organize trainings for commercial companies. And finally, I publish the book.

That's exactly how I wrote my first book for APress titled "Git Recipes":

http://www.apress.com/9781430261032

and more than 15 books concerning various IT topics (all in Polish).

Using the first versions of the text as the complementary stuff for 
commercial trainings and applying the feedback allows me to provide 
the textbook that can be appreciated in real life scenarios.

Thomas Parisot - README Driven Development
------------------------------------------

TDD, BDD, DDD or WTFDD… this is nice but is it helping our teams to start faster on Day 1?

Let's go back to something even simpler and even more essential than a naming: communication.

As we hate specs and like to KISS, let's write documentation first, including examples and intentions. We'll be surprised it's just easier to detect inconsistencies and to share our vision before writing a single line of code.

As a bonus, it works pretty well for Github's Pull Requests too!

Shwetank Dixit - Challenges and approaches taken with the Opera Extension Docs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Opera switched to a Chromium code base (which included most of its extension system), we had a vexing challenge - How do you take something as great as the Chrome extension docs and try to improve upon it? We'll highlight the difficulties Opera faced on improving upon a great product, the tools we are using to do it, and how we're ultimately striving to build a more friendly set of documentation and tutorials. 

Elizabeth Urello - Blogging as Non-Traditional Support Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a Happiness Engineer (support staff) with Automattic, makers of WordPress.com, and I spend a lot of time working on our support documentation. I also write for our blogs, the `WordPress.com News Blog`_ and `The Daily Post`_.

.. _WordPress.com News Blog: http://en.blog.wordpress.com
.. _The Daily Post: http://dailypost.wordpress.com

The Daily Post is a blog aimed at increasing our users' engagement with WordPress.com. Throughout the week, we highlight and explore various features. We also encourage participation and interaction by hosting publishing challenges. 

A sample of users involved in a recent “Zero to Hero” blogging challenge that ran on The Daily Post through the month of January showed that those users posted an average of 9.6 times per blog in the past month, compared to the average 0.2 times of a random sample of users. This means that consistent blogging by staff helped those users publish 48 times as often as a control group. For a company working to democratize publishing, that's a huge impact!

Here are a few of the reasons why blog posts can be superior to traditional support documentation: 

* Unlike support documentation, a reader can follow a blog so that they regularly receive and read articles on different aspects of using the software. This builds their overall knowledge in a gradual and fun way. 
* Blog posts have a comment section for reader feedback and questions, which transforms documentation into conversation. 
* Blog posts are written by an individual author that regular readers of the blog will come to know. This creates an ongoing relationship based around creativity rather than troubleshooting. 
* People in various roles across a company will likely find it easier and more appealing to contribute helpful, support-like blog posts with a personal voice than to do the same with support documentation. Many people are familiar with what makes for a good blog post; the same is not true for writing documentation. 

Many organizations have plans to overhaul existing dry or technical support documentation with more images, a more conversational tone, etc., but it can be overwhelming to begin. Starting an educational,  interactive blog about your product is an easy and immediate way to open a new, more effective conversation with your user base. You’ll be able to experiment with what works best for your users through blogging, and you can then apply that knowledge to improving your traditional support documentation as well.

Sebastien Goasguen - Going from Publican to Read The Docs
---------------------------------------------------------

Picking a documentation format can be a tricky task, many requirements come into play such as ease of use, output format, localization support, experience of documentation writers and so on. In Apache CloudStack we chose DocBook and Publican to write our documentation, over a year into the project we are facing several issues such build problems, difficulty of maintaining and fixing builds, lack of contribution from the community. Something had to be done.
In this talk we will show how we are migrating all our documentation from publican/docbook to restructured text format and Readthedocs.org for build and hosting. The simple markdown like format is a much lower barrier of entry for doc writers and the readthedocs platform provides a build  system, ability to manage releases, localization as well as a very handy github support.
This talk will be a tale of switching documentation format for a major open source project, pros and cons and tips along the way.

Fintan Bolton - The community wrote my docs!
--------------------------------------------

In the world of Open Source software, writers can usually tap into a
rich resource of content, provided by a community of volunteers and
posted (typically) on a collaborative Wiki site. When it comes to
writing formal documentation, this community documentation is a
valuable resource for research; you could even copy part of it into
your work; or maybe, just maybe, could the community write your docs?

This talk examines the pleasures and pitfalls of incorporating
community docs into your formal documentation. The ideal of a
community that could provide you with finished documentation
might remain an unattainable utopia, but it is worth exploring how
close you can get to that point and what obstacles lie in the way.

Jessica Rose - Tone in Documentation
------------------------------------

While technical writing often allows less room for emotive or engaging writing, recognizing the role tone plays in the development of well crafted and useful documentation allows writers to better use tone to meet specific needs in documentation development and to better recognize and excise aspects which may be distracting from their core message. This talk will explore several real world examples of tone in documentation with the goal of helping writers better focus on selecting appropriate tone for their own projects.

One of the biggest challenges in crafting effective documentation is presenting clear and useful data that users from a range of skill levels and backgrounds can engage with. By carefully managing tone, writers can help wrap the data in a voice that communicates of a number of additional factors. Tone allows you to introduce the voice of your brand, provides an emotional connection to the documents and your product, to suggest your user expectations and to paint a picture of how inclusive or exclusive you think your community of users should be.

Robert Lehmann - Self-Directed Learning Material
------------------------------------------------

The domain of Open Educational Resources is seeing a huge uplift in the past months.  How OER is distributed, licensed and used is well described — but how about its creation?

The OpenTechSchool has been giving self-directed workshops under the supervision of volunteer coaches for almost two years now.  In its course it created some well-received and well-acclaimed learning materials, among the ""Python for beginners.""  Among its core values is self-direction, hands-on learning, and internationalization.  This talk will describe how such material come into place, improved and has been used in a community initiative.

The speaker has been involved in the conception and maintenance of the ""Python for beginners"" material and is an active OpenTechSchool coach and organizer.

Christine Burwinkle - Pairing with designers to create a seamless user experience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you change documentation from being an afterthought to an integral part of the user experience? At Atlassian, we believe that pairing technical writers with UX designers is key!

This talk will cover some of the practical ways that technical writers have been pairing with designers to create a single experience for users. The benefits go beyond adding better wording into the UI: in our teams, they've resulted in new features, better docs, and access to customer data that was only a dream a few years ago.

I'll share: 

- Some of the practical ways tech writers and designers have worked together successfully (sparring sessions on user stories, document planning sessions, integration plans for the UI and docs, and leveraging siloed customer data)

- A few practical success stories (a look at actual changes that we've made to our products and documentation due to this collaboration)

- A look at how to make this strategy a success (how to start small, how to pick the right project, how to get buy-in from designers, managers, and others)

Kelly O'Brien - Engage or Die: Four Techniques for Writing Indispensible Docs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter how detailed, how thorough, or how well organized you make your documentation, if it fails to engage your readers, they won’t stick around long enough to hear what you’re telling them. By borrowing time-honored techniques from professional nonfiction writers, you can make sure that your readers connect to your writing, right off the bat. In this talk, I will introduce four writing techniques, and show you how to use them to build docs that your readers will relate to and rely on. 

Spanning both the conceptual and the concrete, these techniques will carry you from the blank page through to your final copyedit. 

Put Your Readers First – One of the earliest lessons that any nonfiction writer learns is how to get into the reader’s head. Think about not only the tasks that your readers need to accomplish, but also the circumstances under which they’re performing those tasks. Demonstrating that you know where your readers are coming from is the first step to gaining their trust. 

Mind Your Tone – Your voice is one of your most powerful tools for engaging your readers—make sure you’re using it wisely. Do your readers seek assurance from an authoritative expert or would they be more comfortable with an easy, conversational tone? Adjusting your writing style to suit your audience can deliver a lot of value for minimal effort. One sympathetic word in the right place, and you’ll be your reader’s best friend. 

Lead with the Problem – When your readers reach for your documentation, they’ve already exhausted their troubleshooting options as well as some (most? all?) of their patience. When you’re organizing your docs, break down your content according to the problems it will solve. That way, your readers can easily find what they’re looking for, and they know that *you* know what’s important to them. 

Use Powerful Pointers – Whether you’re writing a quick feature guide or a full-on user manual, you never want to risk confusing your readers. Keep them on the same page as you by using ample pointer sentences—key transitional statements that provide an infrastructure by which your readers can orient themselves. Pointer sentences have the added benefit of making your documentation friendly to readers of varying skill levels.

Mikey Ariel - Your Personal Tech-Writing Agile Manifesto (or: Scrum is not a 4-character word)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| ag·ile
| adjective \\ˈa-jəl, -ˌjī(-ə)l\\

1. marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace <an agile dancer>
2. having a quick resourceful and adaptable character <an agile mind>
(Merriam-Webster dictionary)

When the Agile Manifesto was first presented to the geeksphere, many thought it was the hottest thing since striped RAID. Since then, agile software development has morphed, evolved, branched out, and yes - been abused. Some companies have revolutionized their productivity, while others simply replaced the term ""specifications"" with the term ""ready documents"" and continued to *think* waterfall while boasting a Kanban board.

We seem to have gotten so caught up in semantics and bureaucracy, we've forgotten about the true meaning of the word ""agile"". Nowadays, employees and companies who have been burned by these twisted agile implementations have all but written off agile methodologies as ""empty buzz words"" and shudder at the mere thought of a sprint.

So what does make the agile methodologies work, and how can I, as a free-thinking, self-managing, maybe even team-leading technical writer, make them work for me, even if I work at a company that doesn't sing the scrum song and couldn't keep its points-poker face straight to safe its life? How can I build my own personal, portable Agile Manifesto, that I can apply to any working environment at any company? 

Idan Gazit - Advanced Web Typography
------------------------------------

Oliver Reichenstein famously quipped that “The Web is 95% Typography.” Most of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It behooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and science of presenting textual information.

This talk isn’t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a rich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press. Although digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still very much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls that the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years. I'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what we can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.

Some highlights:

* A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty details of how it works
* Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features (http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature)
* Icon fonts, and semantic use thereof
* JavaScript tools like fittext.js and lettering.js

Markus Zapke-Gründemann - Writing multi-language documentation using Sphinx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid?

This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.

Jannis Leidel - Search and find. How we made MDN discoverable
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a wiki on which volunteers and Mozilla staff writers document the open Web, Mozilla technologies, Firefox OS, and other developer topics. In 2013 we relaunched it with a new look and feel as well as many changes to the underlying technology. In this talk I look back at how we took content discoverability into account and how we’re continuing to improve the site in 2014.

Tom Christie - Designing MkDocs
-------------------------------

MkDocs is a tool for creating documentation from Markdown, that's focused on simplicity and ease-of-use.
This talk will explore the background, motivation and design of this new documentation builder.
We'll also look at how to write, theme and publish your documentation with MkDocs, and compare it against some other existing tools.
