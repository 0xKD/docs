Włodzimierz Gajda - How to write a technical book?
--------------------------------------------------

Writing interesting and informative books on technical topics requires a mixture of diverse abilities including technical expertise on a specific subject and communication skills.

One of the methods to verify the quality of writings that you plan to publish as your next book is to use them in real life scenario. That's just the way I use to write and publish my books. I begin with a small tutorial. Next, I use the tutorial for teching purposes. After this I organize trainings for commercial companies. And finally, I publish the book.

That's exactly how I wrote my first book for APress titled "Git Recipes":

http://www.apress.com/9781430261032

and more than 15 books concerning various IT topics (all in Polish).

Using the first versions of the text as the complementary stuff for 
commercial trainings and applying the feedback allows me to provide 
the textbook that can be appreciated in real life scenarios.

Thomas Parisot - README Driven Development
------------------------------------------

TDD, BDD, DDD or WTFDD… this is nice but is it helping our teams to start faster on Day 1?

Let's go back to something even simpler and even more essential than a naming: communication.

As we hate specs and like to KISS, let's write documentation first, including examples and intentions. We'll be surprised it's just easier to detect inconsistencies and to share our vision before writing a single line of code.

As a bonus, it works pretty well for Github's Pull Requests too!

Shwetank Dixit - Challenges and approaches taken with the Opera Extension Docs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Opera switched to a Chromium code base (which included most of its extension system), we had a vexing challenge - How do you take something as great as the Chrome extension docs and try to improve upon it? We'll highlight the difficulties Opera faced on improving upon a great product, the tools we are using to do it, and how we're ultimately striving to build a more friendly set of documentation and tutorials. 

Elizabeth Urello - Blogging as Non-Traditional Support Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting an educational, interactive blog about your product is an easy and immediate way to open a new, more effective conversation with your user base. Through blogging, you can explore what sort of help works best for your users, and you can apply that knowledge to improve your traditional support documentation as well. I'll discuss how you can use blogging to:  build your users' overall knowledge in a gradual and fun way; transform documentation into conversation; and create an ongoing relationship with your users that's based around creativity rather than troubleshooting.


Sebastien Goasguen - Going from Publican to Read The Docs
---------------------------------------------------------

Picking a documentation format can be a tricky task, many requirements come into play such as ease of use, output format, localization support, experience of documentation writers and so on. In Apache CloudStack we chose DocBook and Publican to write our documentation, over a year into the project we are facing several issues such build problems, difficulty of maintaining and fixing builds, lack of contribution from the community. Something had to be done.
In this talk we will show how we are migrating all our documentation from publican/docbook to restructured text format and Readthedocs.org for build and hosting. The simple markdown like format is a much lower barrier of entry for doc writers and the readthedocs platform provides a build  system, ability to manage releases, localization as well as a very handy github support.
This talk will be a tale of switching documentation format for a major open source project, pros and cons and tips along the way.

Fintan Bolton - The community wrote my docs!
--------------------------------------------

In the world of Open Source software, writers can usually tap into a
rich resource of content, provided by a community of volunteers and
posted (typically) on a collaborative Wiki site. When it comes to
writing formal documentation, this community documentation is a
valuable resource for research; you could even copy part of it into
your work; or maybe, just maybe, could the community write your docs?

This talk examines the pleasures and pitfalls of incorporating
community docs into your formal documentation. The ideal of a
community that could provide you with finished documentation
might remain an unattainable utopia, but it is worth exploring how
close you can get to that point and what obstacles lie in the way.

Jessica Rose - Tone in Documentation
------------------------------------

While technical writing often allows less room for emotive or engaging writing, recognizing the role tone plays in the development of well crafted and useful documentation allows writers to better use tone to meet specific needs in documentation development and to better recognize and excise aspects which may be distracting from their core message. This talk will explore several real world examples of tone in documentation with the goal of helping writers better focus on selecting appropriate tone for their own projects.

One of the biggest challenges in crafting effective documentation is presenting clear and useful data that users from a range of skill levels and backgrounds can engage with. By carefully managing tone, writers can help wrap the data in a voice that communicates of a number of additional factors. Tone allows you to introduce the voice of your brand, provides an emotional connection to the documents and your product, to suggest your user expectations and to paint a picture of how inclusive or exclusive you think your community of users should be.

Robert Lehmann - Self-Directed Learning Material
------------------------------------------------

The domain of Open Educational Resources has seen a huge uplift in the past months. How OER is distributed, licensed and used is well described — but how about its creation?

The OpenTechSchool has been giving self-directed workshops under the supervision of volunteer coaches for almost two years now. In its course it created some well-received and well-acclaimed learning material, including "Python for beginners." Among its core values is self-direction, hands-on learning, and internationalization. This talk will describe how the material came into place, improved over time, and has been successfully utilized in a community initiative.

The speaker has been involved in the conception and maintenance of the "Python for beginners" material and is an active OpenTechSchool coach and organizer.

Christine Burwinkle - Pairing with designers to create a seamless user experience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you change documentation from being an afterthought to an integral part of the user experience? At Atlassian, we believe that pairing technical writers with UX designers is key!

This talk will cover some of the practical ways that technical writers have been pairing with designers to create a single experience for users. The benefits go beyond adding better wording into the UI: in our teams, they've resulted in new features, better docs, and access to customer data that was only a dream a few years ago.

I'll share: 

- Some of the practical ways tech writers and designers have worked together successfully (sparring sessions on user stories, document planning sessions, integration plans for the UI and docs, and leveraging siloed customer data)

- A few practical success stories (a look at actual changes that we've made to our products and documentation due to this collaboration)

- A look at how to make this strategy a success (how to start small, how to pick the right project, how to get buy-in from designers, managers, and others)

Kelly O'Brien - Engage or Die: Four Techniques for Writing Indispensible Docs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter how detailed, how thorough, or how well organized you make your documentation, if it fails to engage your readers, they won’t stick around long enough to hear what you’re telling them. By borrowing time-honored techniques from professional nonfiction writers, you can make sure that your readers connect to your writing, right off the bat. In this talk, I will introduce four writing techniques, and show you how to use them to build docs that your readers will relate to and rely on.  


Mikey Ariel - Your Personal Tech-Writing Agile Manifesto (or: Scrum is not a 4-character word)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| ag·ile
| adjective \\ˈa-jəl, -ˌjī(-ə)l\\

1. marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace <an agile dancer>
2. having a quick resourceful and adaptable character <an agile mind>

(Merriam-Webster dictionary)

When the Agile Manifesto was first presented to the geeksphere, many thought it was the hottest thing since striped RAID. Since then, agile software development has morphed, evolved, branched out, and yes - been abused. Some companies have revolutionized their productivity, while others simply renamed “specifications” to ”ready documents” and continued to think waterfall while boasting a Kanban board.

We seem to have gotten so caught up in semantics and bureaucracy that we’ve forgotten about the true meaning of the word “agile”. Nowadays, employees and companies who have been burned by these twisted agile implementations have all but written off agile methodologies as ”empty buzz words” and shudder at the mere thought of a sprint. And in any case, agile methodologies are only for developers, right? Maybe not!

So what does make agile methodologies work, and how can I, a free-thinking, self-managing, maybe even team-leading technical writer, make them work for me, even if I work at a company that doesn’t sing the scrum song and couldn’t keep its points-poker face straight? How can I build my own personal, portable Agile Manifesto, that I can apply to any working environment at any company?

\* Mikey Ariel is a senior technical writer at Red Hat, with writing experience in waterfall and agile environments. As luck (or misfortune) would have it, she also trained and worked as a scrum master long enough to form a semi-educated philosophy about life, the universe, and stand-up meetings.

Idan Gazit - Advanced Web Typography
------------------------------------

Oliver Reichenstein famously quipped that “The Web is 95% Typography.” Most of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It behooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and science of presenting textual information.

This talk isn’t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a rich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press. Although digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still very much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls that the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years. I'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what we can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.

Some highlights:

* A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty details of how it works
* Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features (http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature)
* Icon fonts, and semantic use thereof
* JavaScript tools like fittext.js and lettering.js

Markus Zapke-Gründemann - Writing multi-language documentation using Sphinx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid?

This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.

Jannis Leidel - Search and find. How we made MDN discoverable
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a wiki on which volunteers and Mozilla staff writers document the open Web, Mozilla technologies, Firefox OS, and other developer topics. In 2013 we relaunched it with a new look and feel as well as many changes to the underlying technology. In this talk I look back at how we took content discoverability into account and how we’re continuing to improve the site in 2014.

Tom Christie - Designing MkDocs
-------------------------------

MkDocs is a tool for creating documentation from Markdown, that's focused on simplicity and ease-of-use.

This talk will explore the background, motivation and design of this new documentation builder.
We'll also look at how to write, theme and publish your documentation with MkDocs, and compare it against some other existing tools.

Kristof Van Tomme - Keeping trust: Testing documentation as part of a continuous integration process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could argue that outdated documentation is even worse than no
documentation at all. It creates frustration and destroys the trust of
your customers. But how do you maintain your documentation in a
project with a fast release cycle?

In this talk I will explore strategies for keeping different types of
documentation up to date and discuss a few tools (including WalkHub,
an open source project we are working on) that can be used to
automatically test or even update documentation as part of your
continuous integration process.

A. Jesse Jiryu Davis - Writing an Excellent Programming Blog 
------------------------------------------------------------

Please, help our community: share your programming knowledge by writing about it. It doesn’t matter how narrow your expertise is. If you know better than anyone how to parse NYC subway schedules in Python, write about it!

Being known in your community as an expert or as a cogent explainer helps you, too. You’re more likely to get patches accepted by projects, get talks accepted by conferences, get a job, get users. Besides, writing teaches you to think: there’s no test of understanding so rigorous as writing an explanation. These days, when there's a problem I don't understand, I start drafting an article about it: I know by the time I'm done writing that I'll have attained the knowledge I seek.

I notice roughly five formats among the best programming articles: stories, arguments, how-tos, how things work, and reviews. For each format I’ll discuss its structure and suggest ideas for what you could write about, and share some do’s or don’ts. If you want to write but haven’t chosen a topic, or don’t know how to approach it, this will get you started.

Each programming language's "planet" aggregator is among the best channels for distributing your articles. Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter have some value, too. You shouldn’t waste time on SEO. Writing isn't about reach, it's about satisfaction. Anyway, if you’re aggregated by sites devoted to your specialty, the audience that matters will come.

Emulate the best bloggers and the best posts. I’ll share links and discuss, from examples, what makes a great article.

You know something about programming that’s worth explaining. Plus, explaining it deepens your understanding as nothing else can. If you don’t know what to write about, riff off the ideas this talk suggests, or get inspired by great blogs. Craft articles of enduring value.


David Hooker - What I have taught developers about writing
----------------------------------------------------------

And to a lesser extent, what they may have taught me. 

I arrived at Prezi as a technical writer used to dealing with engineers of the construction variety. The only developer I’d ever met previously was my mum. I now work long hours writing material that explains, promotes, evangelizes, and sometimes even influences their work. 

This talk is about the challenges, learning curves, and (most importantly) vaguely amusing anecdotes of my eighteen months living amongst those who code. Or to put it in developer-speak, I include best practices as well as experiences of how I messed up when trying to convince 120 engineers that they needed to place greater value on words, write more often, and that they needed my help doing it.
