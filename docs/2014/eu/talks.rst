Thomas Parisot - README Driven Development
------------------------------------------

TDD, BDD, DDD or WTFDD… this is nice but is it helping our teams to start faster on Day 1?

Let's go back to something even simpler and even more essential than a naming: communication.

As we hate specs and like to KISS, let's write documentation first, including examples and intentions. We'll be surprised it's just easier to detect inconsistencies and to share our vision before writing a single line of code.

As a bonus, it works pretty well for Github's Pull Requests too!

Shwetank Dixit - Challenges and approaches taken with the Opera Extension Docs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Opera switched to a Chromium code base (which included most of its extension system), we had a vexing challenge - How do you take something as great as the Chrome extension docs and try to improve upon it? We'll highlight the difficulties Opera faced on improving upon a great product, the tools we are using to do it, and how we're ultimately striving to build a more friendly set of documentation and tutorials.

Elizabeth Urello - Blogging as Non-Traditional Support Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting an educational, interactive blog about your product is an easy and immediate way to open a new, more effective conversation with your user base. Through blogging, you can explore what sort of help works best for your users, and you can apply that knowledge to improve your traditional support documentation as well. 

I'll discuss how you can use blogging to:  build your users' overall knowledge in a gradual and fun way; transform documentation into conversation; and create an ongoing relationship with your users that's based around creativity rather than troubleshooting.

Sebastien Goasguen - Going from Publican to Read the Docs
---------------------------------------------------------

Picking a documentation format can be a tricky task, many requirements come into play such as ease of use, output format, localization support, experience of documentation writers and so on. In Apache CloudStack we chose DocBook and Publican to write our documentation, over a year into the project we are facing several issues such build problems, difficulty of maintaining and fixing builds, lack of contribution from the community. Something had to be done.

In this talk we will show how we are migrating all our documentation from publican/docbook to restructured text format and Readthedocs.org for build and hosting. The simple markdown like format is a much lower barrier of entry for doc writers and the readthedocs platform provides a build  system, ability to manage releases, localization as well as a very handy github support.

This talk will be a tale of switching documentation format for a major open source project, pros and cons and tips along the way.

Fintan Bolton - The community wrote my docs!
--------------------------------------------
In the world of Open Source software, writers can usually tap into a
rich resource of content, provided by a community of volunteers and
posted (typically) on a collaborative Wiki site. When it comes to
writing formal documentation, this community documentation is a
valuable resource for research; you could even copy part of it into
your work; or maybe, just maybe, could the community write your docs?

This talk examines the pleasures and pitfalls of incorporating
community docs into your formal documentation. The ideal of a
community that could provide you with finished documentation
might remain an unattainable utopia, but it is worth exploring how
close you can get to that point and what obstacles lie in the way.

Jessica Rose - Tone in Documentation
------------------------------------
This talk will explore how to balance appropriate tone selection in documentation with creating clear and useful documentation. Used well, the tone of your documentation can help you communicate the voice of your brand, who your desired audience is, what you hope for users to accomplish and more. Awkwardly applied or overreaching tone use may instead patronize users or turn them off of your product.
 
We'll take a look at real world examples of great tone in documentation and documentation where it misses the mark with the hope that it will leave participants better able to incorporate audience effective tone into their docs.

Robert Lehmann - Self-Directed Learning Material
------------------------------------------------

The domain of Open Educational Resources has seen a huge uplift in the past months. How OER is distributed, licensed and used is well described — but how about its creation?

The OpenTechSchool has been giving self-directed workshops under the supervision of volunteer coaches for almost two years now. In its course it created some well-received and well-acclaimed learning material, including "Python for beginners." Among its core values is self-direction, hands-on learning, and internationalization. This talk will describe how the material came into place, improved over time, and has been successfully utilized in a community initiative.

The speaker has been involved in the conception and maintenance of the "Python for beginners" material and is an active OpenTechSchool coach and organizer.

Christine Burwinkle - Pairing with designers to create a seamless user experience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you change documentation from being an afterthought to an integral part of the user experience? At Atlassian, we believe that pairing technical writers with UX designers is key!

This talk will cover some of the practical ways that technical writers have been pairing with designers to create a single experience for users. The benefits go beyond adding better wording into the UI: in our teams, they've resulted in new features, better docs, and access to customer data that was only a dream a few years ago.

I'll share: 

- Some of the practical ways tech writers and designers have worked together successfully (sparring sessions on user stories, document planning sessions, integration plans for the UI and docs, and leveraging siloed customer data)

- A few practical success stories (a look at actual changes that we've made to our products and documentation due to this collaboration)

- A look at how to make this strategy a success (how to start small, how to pick the right project, how to get buy-in from designers, managers, and others)

Kelly O'Brien - Engage or Die: Four Techniques for Writing Indispensable Docs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter how detailed, how thorough, or how well organized you make your documentation, if it fails to engage your readers, they won’t stick around long enough to hear what you’re telling them. By borrowing time-honored techniques from professional nonfiction writers, you can make sure that your readers connect to your writing, right off the bat. 

In this talk, I will introduce four writing techniques, and show you how to use them to build docs that your readers will relate to and rely on.

Mikey Ariel - Your Personal Tech-Writing Agile Manifesto (or: Scrum is not a 4-character word)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| ag·ile
| adjective \\ˈa-jəl, -ˌjī(-ə)l\\

1. marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace <an agile dancer>
2. having a quick resourceful and adaptable character <an agile mind>

(Merriam-Webster dictionary)

When the Agile Manifesto was first presented to the geeksphere, many thought it was the hottest thing since striped RAID. Since then, agile software development has morphed, evolved, branched out, and yes - been abused. Some companies have revolutionized their productivity, while others simply renamed “specifications” to ”ready documents” and continued to think waterfall while boasting a Kanban board.

We seem to have gotten so caught up in semantics and bureaucracy that we’ve forgotten about the true meaning of the word “agile”. Nowadays, employees and companies who have been burned by these twisted agile implementations have all but written off agile methodologies as ”empty buzz words” and shudder at the mere thought of a sprint. And in any case, agile methodologies are only for developers, right? Maybe not!

So what does make agile methodologies work, and how can I, a free-thinking, self-managing, maybe even team-leading technical writer, make them work for me, even if I work at a company that doesn’t sing the scrum song and couldn’t keep its points-poker face straight? How can I build my own personal, portable Agile Manifesto, that I can apply to any working environment at any company?

\* Mikey Ariel is a senior technical writer at Red Hat, with writing experience in waterfall and agile environments. As luck (or misfortune) would have it, she also trained and worked as a scrum master long enough to form a semi-educated philosophy about life, the universe, and stand-up meetings.

Idan Gazit - Advanced Web Typography
------------------------------------

Oliver Reichenstein famously quipped that “The Web is 95% Typography.” Most of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It behooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and science of presenting textual information.

This talk isn’t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a rich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press. Although digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still very much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls that the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years. I'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what we can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.

Some highlights:

* A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty details of how it works
* Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features (http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature)
* Icon fonts, and semantic use thereof
* JavaScript tools like fittext.js and lettering.js

Markus Zapke-Gründemann - Writing multi-language documentation using Sphinx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid?

This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.

Jannis Leidel - Search and find. How we made MDN discoverable
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a wiki on which volunteers and Mozilla staff writers document the open Web, Mozilla technologies, Firefox OS, and other developer topics. In 2013 we relaunched it with a new look and feel as well as many changes to the underlying technology. In this talk I look back at how we took content discoverability into account and how we’re continuing to improve the site in 2014.

Tom Christie - Designing MkDocs
-------------------------------

MkDocs is a tool for creating documentation from Markdown, that's focused on simplicity and ease-of-use.

This talk will explore the background, motivation and design of this new documentation builder.
We'll also look at how to write, theme and publish your documentation with MkDocs, and compare it against some other existing tools.

Kristof Van Tomme - Keeping trust: Testing documentation as part of a continuous integration process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could argue that outdated documentation is even worse than no
documentation at all. It creates frustration and destroys the trust of
your customers. But how do you maintain your documentation in a
project with a fast release cycle?

In this talk I will explore strategies for keeping different types of
documentation up to date and discuss a few tools (including WalkHub,
an open source project we are working on) that can be used to
automatically test or even update documentation as part of your
continuous integration process.

David Hooker - What I have taught developers about writing
----------------------------------------------------------

And to a lesser extent, what they may have taught me. 

I arrived at Prezi as a technical writer used to dealing with engineers of the construction variety. The only developer I’d ever met previously was my mum. I now work long hours writing material that explains, promotes, evangelizes, and sometimes even influences their work. 

This talk is about the challenges, learning curves, and (most importantly) vaguely amusing anecdotes of my eighteen months living amongst those who code. Or to put it in developer-speak, I include best practices as well as experiences of how I messed up when trying to convince 120 engineers that they needed to place greater value on words, write more often, and that they needed my help doing it.

Swizec Teller - What I learned writing a lousy tech book
--------------------------------------------------------

Last year I pounced on a chance to write a book about d3.js. Yes! My first book deal! This is going to be the greatest technical book the world has ever seen. It's going to sell so many copies and I will be rich and famous and everyone is going to learn so very much!

But I soon found out that stuffing EVERYTHING into 120 pages is ... hard. Editors get in the way and publishers have deadlines and by the time the book came out I hated it. It's too fast paced, people can't learn from it, and all the examples I was so proud of are kind of lame.

Turns out there's a reason why so many technical books are bad. In this talk I'm going to explain why I don't like mine and how you can do better.
