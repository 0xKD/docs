We can recomend a couple places though.

A Former Four-Star Hotel that's now a Wombat's City Hostel.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We think this is one of the most splendid hostels you’ll see anywhere in the world, and one of the most affordable too. The location certainly couldn’t be better: a very short walk from Deák Square, the city’s main transportation hub, all three metro lines stop here. And more importantly, it's just five minutes walk from the conference.
