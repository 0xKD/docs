Marko Gargenta - TechDocs at Twitter: Creating the culture of documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Twitter Engineering has grown quickly, to well over a thousand engineers in the space of a few years. In the process, scores of teams have developed hundreds of individual services and libraries. During this time, these teams have been supported by at most three full­time tech writers.

This is a story of how we work towards creating the culture of documentation. To implement this culture, we needed to introduce new tools that are seamless for the developer workflow and to bring the teams along with education and training. In this talk, you will learn what worked and what didn’t for Twitter engineering documentation.

Matthew Lyon - Minimum Viable Documentation
-------------------------------------------

You're working at a startup building a "minimum viable product" -- and everything about the product is being cut down to bare minimum to reduce the risk and cost of failure.  Deciding what to include in "Minimum Viable" is difficult, and the value of documentation in service of product development is often misunderstood by project managers who work in this style, who often choose to forego documentation altogether.  

I will make the case for including documentation in "viable": We'll consider ways of understanding your target audience, helping introduce them to your software and getting them unstuck, and make the case for minimum-viable in-house developer documentation.


Amelia Abreu - Data, Documentation, & Memory
--------------------------------------------

In this presentation, I explore the role of documentation and technical writing in shaping larger recordkeeping and memory practices. How does documentation shape institutional memory? How does it validate and enforce definitions and boundaries? What roles do documentarians play in the larger ecosystem of development?

Drawing on my experiences as a UX Researcher and an academic HCI background, I introduce concepts from archival and critical theory. Examining both data and metadata structures, I argue for an infrastructural understanding of documentation, one that acknowledges documentation practice as crucial scaffolding for the development process. In conclusion, I present recommendations for maximizing the value of archival documentation and improving data retention and retrieval.


Susan Salurito - From Docs to Engineering and Back Again
--------------------------------------------------------

When you head into a career as an API technical writer, you’re treading dangerously close to engineering territory. You have to know enough about software developer to write for an audience of developers, yet you also have to be an experienced and efficient writer of English prose. When a writer crosses the line into software development, how does she balance the need to write with the need to code (short of criticizing the grammar in code comments)? This is the story of how I started out as a technical writer, transitioned to release engineering, and came back to the documentation world, and what that experience taught me. 


R. N. Homer Christensen - Flow: A Permaculture Approach to Documentation Projects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permaculture is all the rage in the organic and urban farming circles, but it is a design science rooted in observation that has applications far beyond vegetables and fruits. 
Its basic tenets include observing the environment to discern the patterns, the risk areas, and other factors that will influence your work, and then working within those constraints using the least amount of energy and costly outside inputs to produce a harmonious, sustainable, and perennial system that yields a healthy return and requires the least amount of work to maintain.

This presentation introduces some of the core practices of permaculture that can be immediately applied to any project to make it more successful, more enjoyable, and better suited to its intended audience.

Participants will discover:

* Why it is important to design from the patterns to the details.
* The edge where two systems meet (think engineering and customer service) yields the most innovation.
* Diversity is important to incorporate and honor.
* Ways to stack function… where one element performs multiple roles (like single-sourcing).
* How to plan for zones of access… so that your audience can quickly locate the most important, most frequently used information.

It's a fresh and intuitive approach, a Zen view of something that many of us have done for years. In Permaculture, the problem is the solution. Or perhaps more properly said: in any problem lies the solution.


Geoffrey Grosenbach	- Graphical Explanations
--------------------------------------------

As Frederick Brooks observed in "The Mythical Man-Month", computer programmers build not with boards and hammers but with "pure thought stuff". Sometimes it can be difficult to explain abstract technical concepts just with words. Fortunately we can use colors, shapes and animations to explain ideas that would otherwise be confusing. You'll see dozens of examples and learn to make your own.


Alex Gaynor - Documenting Domain Specific Knowledge	
----------------------------------------------------

Most of my career as a software engineer, I've written documentation for very general purpose tools, where users' had an existing familiarity. For the last six months I've been working on a cryptography library, a domain most developers are ignorant of. We set out with the goal of making our documentation accessible to any developer, regardless of previous cryptographic experience, which presents unique challenges. This talk will dive into what these challenges are, and how we try to solve them.


Kenneth Reitz - Documentation at Scale
--------------------------------------

Information is powerful — every day we see it transform the world around us.

Documentation doesn't always have to be about a software workflow or open source project — it can be used to develop and convey ideas much larger than yourself. Information architecture is a powerful tool for developing ideas over time. It enables us to evolve and distill information at a much larger scale than a single person or team could ever achieve on their own. 

Take these concepts, and apply open source workflow tools like GitHub's Pull Requests and Write the Docs, and the distributed evolution of ideas and information has never been more accessible.

We'll explore these concepts, learn how to foster a community of distributed contributors, encourage contributions early on, and more.

Python-Guide.org will be used as an example, a Python-specific knowledge base written by 168 people and accessed by over 50,000 people every month. 


Mo Nishiyama - Did It In Minutes: The Art of Documenting Meeting Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If elegant technical help pages are the shiny, sleek roadsters of the documentation world, the plebeian meeting minutes are the dump trucks. Despite being regarded as an unglamorous business tool, minutes serve an important function for communicating effectively with colleagues.

Meeting minutes document changes to business operations, chronicle the decisions that were made, capture the essential gist of discussions, and serve as handy references for those colleagues who were unable to attend the meeting--or for those who indulged in siestas during the gathering. Minutes can even justify whether a meeting was necessary in the first place.

Effective minutes can save companies labor costs: well-written meeting notes can prevent both meeting organizers and absent team members valuable time that would otherwise be spent trying to bring absentees up to speed. Accurate meeting notes can clearly define policies and expectations in a workgroup.

In this presentation, we will discuss best practices for documenting and curating meeting notes. Using meeting templates, de-mystifying technical jargons, breaking free of the chronological reporting, adhering to the WTF (Write The Facts) approach, carving time for editing notes, charting follow-up tasks, and judiciously spicing up otherwise-mundane topics are  examples of these best practices. Special emphasis will be placed on writing with clarity and empathy in mind for team members, whether they were present at the meeting or not.


Nina Vyedin - Hacking the English Language
------------------------------------------

A good doc is like a good program: beautifully architected, free of clutter, and easy for others to understand and maintain. In this session we’ll explore a programmatic approach to writing conceptual content, including the application of design patterns to writing, principles of good doc structure (architecture), and the importance of word choice and clarity (naming your variables). 

We’ll review “code samples”  - examples of real sentences from docs - and refactor them into clear, straightforward explanations that help the reader learn. Throughout the talk, we’ll introduce a new way for developers to think about writing and for writers to think about the technology we are documenting.


Siobhan McKeown - Writing for your other half
---------------------------------------------

Writing documentation is all about writing for other people. When I write docs I write them for my husband, not because I'm currently writing a practical guide to marriage, but because keeping him in mind makes my documentation better: if he can understand it, anyone can. There are plenty of things that I've learned throughout the years just by keeping him in mind when I sit down to write.
