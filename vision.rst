Any good movement has a vision. We are looking to slowly change how you view the world, and how the world views what you do.

Programmers
-----------

If you are a programmer, you have a need to create something. You solve interesting problems. However, if you solve an interesting problem and nobody knows about the solution, you haven't solved anything.

**For programmers, documentation is how they share their creations with the world. If you want people to benefit from your work, they have to be able to use it. Help me, help you. Do something and change something.**


Companies
---------

You want to save money. You want to have happy customers. Writing good documentation saves on your support costs, elating customers because they don't need to contact support, and makes your product better all around.

Enterprises
-----------

Big companies don't use undocumented software. If you care about Open Source, help adoption in the world by writing documentation.
